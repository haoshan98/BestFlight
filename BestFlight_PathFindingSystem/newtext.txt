south korea's trade minister has urged japan to accept the world trade organization's decision that upheld seoul's import restrictions on japanese seafood following the 2011 fukushima nuclear disaster seoul's trade ministry said friday



during an informal trade ministerial gathering at the wto held in france earlier this week south korean trade minister yoo myung-hee said the final verdict from the organization's appellate body should be respected according to the ministry



yoo claimed it is also inappropriate for japan to continue raising questions against the wto dispute settlement system







(yonhap)

south korea has been placing import restrictions on 28 kinds of fish caught from eight prefectures near fukushima since september2013 on concerns over their radiation levels after the nuclear power plant accidentin 2015 japan officially lodged a complaint at the wto against south korea's ban and additional testing requirements with its dispute settlement body initially ruling in favor of japan in 2018last month however the wto appellate body overturned its previous decision saying the seoul government's measures are not unfair trade restrictions and do not fall into the category of arbitrary discriminationsince the announcement of the final verdict japan has been calling the decision regrettable and claimed that the wto should go through reforms as its dispute settlement system failed to operate properlytokyo also continued to ask south korea to lift the import ban through different diplomatic channels with seoul maintaining its stance to make public health and safety its top priority (yonhap)korea is under increasing us pressure to take sides in washington's war against china's huawei the government has so far expressed reluctance to intervene in the affairs of private korean businesses that want to use huawei equipment but insiders warn that seoul will find it difficult to sit on the fence much longer as us president donald trump tries to bully captive allies into submission

japan and australia have already joined the boycott but korea would stand to face massive reprisals from china if it does china now accounts for a bigger proportion of korea's exports than the us eu and japan combined buying around us$1421 billion worth of products from korea in 2017 or 248 percent of the country's total exports

one diplomatic source said "during a dispute over a terminal high-altitude area defense battery china picked on the weak link which was korea" but left japan alone even though it is home to more of the us anti-missile batteries "this time china's retaliation could be even worse"

korea has long understood itself as being diplomatically a shrimp among whales sitting as it did on the eastern frontline of the cold war

pressure is only expected to grow us president donald trump is scheduled to visit korea late next month while president moon jae-in is seeking to meet with chinese president xi jinping around that time as well seoul needs to cooperate closely with washington to jump-start stalled dialogue with pyongyang while beijing's role is also crucial in the process

"the anti-huawei campaign could make things difficult for korea which needs to bridge differences with the us over denuclearization while maintaining close ties with china" said nam joo-hong at kyonggi university

shin beom-chul a senior researcher at the asan institute for policy studies added "the government should have taken a more vigorous position during the thaad boycott by treating it as a security matter but korea showed signs of wavering this time it needs a clear set of positions for the huawei dispute and look for ways to dodge pressure from both the us and china"
